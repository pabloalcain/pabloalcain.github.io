## Exercises and solutions in Quantum Chemistry

Here are the exercises in molecules we use in teaching our course in
[Quantum Chemistry](http://materias.df.uba.ar/e3a2016c1/) in the
[Physics Department](http://df.uba.ar/) of the
[University of Buenos Aires](http://www.uba.ar/). Since, as expected,
this course is given in Spanish, the exercises and solutions are given
also in Spanish. Should anyone ever wonder about these solutions, I'll
be happy to translate them to English.
