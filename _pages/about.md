I am a PhD student and Teaching Assistant on the
[Physics Department](http://df.uba.ar/) of the
[Universidad de Buenos Aires](http://www.uba.ar/) under the
supervision of Claudio Dorso.

I currently work on Neutron Star Crust and the *Nuclear Pasta*, the set
of structures that are supposed to be found in neutron stars for
densities lower than nuclear saturation.

Two main subjects are of our interest: the thermodynamics of the
Neutron Star and the nuclear symmetry energy. We are currently in the
search of potential observable quantities that might give us a hint on
either the Equation of State of dense nuclear matter or the symmetry
energy term.
