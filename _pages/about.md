I don't want to write a résumé here, but some info about myself is probably warranted.
I'm a physicist by training, turned statistician and machine learning engineer by trade.
Probably that's what describes best my professional career: I'm a bit restless.
I really enjoy coding, and I focused my PhD on developing software for science and (well, it was a physics PhD after all) using that software for research.
Since then, I've worked at the intersection between science and software engineering, finding good solutions to hard problems and building the software needed to put those solutions to the test.

Over the years I have worked in several different things, but my favorite topics (for now. Again, I'm a bit restless) would be:
- Experimentation (yes A/B testing, but not only A/B testing)
- Developing Machine Learning platforms that allow Data Scientist to do their work in a scalable and maintainable way, while keeping flexibility.

I enjoy playing chess, though I'm not good at it.
I also like to play the guitar, though I'm not good at it.
I'd love to try theater. I don't think I'll be good at it but, as you might see, that won't stop me.
I have, of course, a [favorite xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1205/), a favorite Linux distro and a favorite text editor.
Those I won't reveal, I'd rather stay clear of flame wars.
